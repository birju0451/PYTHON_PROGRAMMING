# Normal code: starts without space (no indentation)
print("Program Started")

# If block – needs indentation
if 10 > 5:
    print("10 is greater than 5")
    print("These two lines are inside the if block")
# This line is outside the if block (no space)
print("This is outside the if block")

# Loop example
for i in range(3):
    print("Loop number:", i)
    print("This line is also inside the loop")

# Function example
def greet():
    print("Hello from function")
    print("Both lines are inside the function")

# Calling the function
greet()

print("Program Ended")
